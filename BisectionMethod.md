The bisection method is a root finding method relies upon the fact that f(x) = 0 at x_root.
Therefore roots are found by zero crossings on a cartesian graph where f(x) is the axis perpendicular to the x axis.

If we can select initial values of x_min and x_max that we know bracket a given single zero crossing. Then we know the sign of f(x) on one side of the x axis from x_root is the opposite of the sign of f(x) on the other side of x_root.
